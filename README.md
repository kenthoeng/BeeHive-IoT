# BeeHive-IoT

## Real-Time Monitoring and Control for Beekeeping

### Overview
BeeHive-IoT is an IoT-based system designed to help beekeepers monitor and control their hive environments effectively. By leveraging modern technologies like sensors, microcontrollers, fuzzy logic, and machine learning, this project ensures optimal conditions for honeybee colonies and enhances the sustainability of honey production.

### How It Works
1. **Sensors**: Gather environmental data from the beehive.
2. **Microcontroller**: Processes sensor data using C++ firmware.
3. **Decision-Making**:  
   - Fuzzy logic adjusts actuators (e.g., fans, heaters, servo motors) based on real-time conditions.
   - Machine learning predicts trends and suggests optimizations.
4. **Web Dashboard**:  
   - Displays real-time data and historical trends.
   - Allows manual control of hive parameters.
